                            <b>Experience Increased Accuracy:</b> Elevate your depreciation calculations with our specialized module. Traditionally, Odoo apps have been limited, allowing the degressive method decimals up to two places. This becomes a substantial hurdle when handling complex and nuanced depreciation schedules, such as monthly depreciations.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <b>Innovation and Adaptability:</b> Our module triumphs over these restrictions, enhancing decimal precision for a richer, more detailed depreciation analysis. Crafted for excellence, it synergizes well with the community edition and fully embraces the robust capabilities of Odoo Mate's module, om_account_assets, fortifying its position as a pivotal tool in proficient asset management.
